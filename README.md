Problem Statement:

You are a data analyst for an e-commerce company.
The marketing team wants to visualize the distribution of product categories
in their inventory to better understand which areas might need more focus
or promotion.
They've asked you to create a treemap that shows the hierarchy and relative
sizes of different product categories.
Your task is to:
Create a sample dataset of product categories and their quantities.
Use Python to process this data and create a treemap visualization.
Ensure the treemap clearly shows the hierarchy of main categories and
subcategories.
Use color coding to distinguish between different main categories.
Include labels for each category and subcategory, along with their
respective quantities.
Please write a Python script that generates the required dataset and creates
the treemap visualization.
Make sure your code is efficient and well-commented for future reference.
